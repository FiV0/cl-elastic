# Cl-Elasticsearch - Elasticsearch client for Common Lisp

## Motivation

This project is supposed to be a simple interface for Elasticsearch. The
emphasis is on simple, i.e. this is not supposed to be a DSL on top of 
another DSL. You should be able go to the Elasticsearch docs and translate
that immediatly into working code. If you are looking for a DSL, checkout
the section about other work.
